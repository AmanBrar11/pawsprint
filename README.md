There is an escalating stray dog problem in Argentina, leading to significant challenges for underfunded animal shelters, which struggle with funding, organization, and volunteer recruitment. In collaboration with Vinoly, Paws Print has developed three deliverables aimed at addressing these issues: a resource guide offering best practices for shelter organization, a landing page for Vinoly’s website, and a platform we designed that connects shelters with volunteers. Paws Print aspires to create a lasting impact on animal welfare in Argentina.

Projects Detailed Below:


*__Resource Guideline__*

Our team has conducted extensive research and collaborated with leading U.S. animal shelters to identify best practices for shelter structure and organization. The resource guide aims to empower underfunded shelters in Argentina. All of our research and findings are detailed on this project’s Notion page.

*__Landing Page for Vinoly__*

Vinoly proposed an application focused on corporate social responsibility that connects resources and funds with animal shelters in Argentina. We designed a landing page for this application to best inform users of their mission. Our prototypes can be found on its respective Figma page. The design was led by Vinoly to best work with their Paws Print application.

*__Platform for Volunteer Opportunities__*

Shelters are having trouble finding volunteers. Many people want to help but don’t know how. We designed a website to help bridge the gap between shelters and volunteers. Our website prototype can be found on its respective Figma page. This website is meant to be an extension, but not absolutely related, to our Resource Guideline research. We wanted to provide support to one facet of our research, which is the volunteering gap with animal shelters. This is also meant to provide design inspiration to Vinoly wherever they see fit.

After the University of Washington’s Spring 2023 quarter, Vinoly will have complete ownership of the projects below and Gradient will have no ownership or involvement in all of these projects. To contact the project owner, email them at belisa@vinoly.tech
